House Price Prediction Model

Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on various features such as number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and more.

Features

- Predicts house prices based on historical data
- Uses a combination of numerical and categorical features
- Implements data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation

Data

- The data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

Model

- The model used is a [insert model type, e.g. Random Forest Regressor]
- Hyperparameters are tuned using [insert hyperparameter tuning method]

Performance

- The model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of [insert MAE value] on the testing set
- The model's performance is evaluated using [insert evaluation metrics, e.g. MAE, MSE, R2]

Usage

- Clone the repository and install the required dependencies
- Run the model using [insert instructions, e.g. python (link unavailable)]
